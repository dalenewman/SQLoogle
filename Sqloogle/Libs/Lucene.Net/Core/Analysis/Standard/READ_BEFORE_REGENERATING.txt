WARNING: if you change StandardTokenizerImpl.jflex and need to regenerate
      the tokenizer, only use Java 1.4 !!!
      This grammar currently uses constructs (eg :digit:, :letter:) whose 
      meaning can vary according to the JRE used to run jflex.  See
      https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-1126 for details.
      For current backwards compatibility it is needed to support
      only Java 1.4 - this will change in Lucene 3.1.
